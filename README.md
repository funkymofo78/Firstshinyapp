# Worlds Top Companies

The Aim of this project is to offer an application that is simple to use for the exploration of the top 2000 companies in the world. I have tried to make this very easy to use and very interactive. The main target audience is the general public apart from the K- Means clustering tab at the end.
I have introduced the data in my first tab and an easy-to-follow table that anyone could use to filter data.
In the second tab a user can visualise where in the world a company, in the top 100, is located and get a brief overview of what business that company is in. 
In tab 3 a user can explore some simple summary statistics like mean, max, min for the four numerical variables, a user can do this by country and can then see the number of companies in each country for a certain market value range in the histogram. 
Tab 4 would probably not be aimed at the general public; it gives the user the option to group companies by two numerical variables at a time and is aimed at someone with a statistics background to demonstrate some machine learning techniques. 


See below a walk through of what the app does.
